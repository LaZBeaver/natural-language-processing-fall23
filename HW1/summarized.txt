$$Nipah virus
transmission is thought to have occurred via unprotected exposure to secretions from the pigs, or unprotected contact with the tissue of a sick animal.in subsequent outbreaks in bangladesh and india, consumption of fruits or fruit products (such as raw date palm juice) contaminated with urine or saliva from infected fruit bats was the most likely source of infection.there are currently no studies on viral persistence in bodily fluids or the environment including fruits.human-to-human transmission of nipah virus has also been reported among family and care givers of infected patients.during the later outbreaks in bangladesh and india, nipah virus spread directly from human-to-human through close contact with people's secretions and excretions. this hypothesis was reinforced with the evidence of henipavirus infection in pteropus bats from australia, bangladesh, cambodia, china, india, indonesia, madagascar, malaysia, papua new guinea, thailand and timor-leste.african fruit bats of the genus eidolon, family pteropodidae, were found positive for antibodies against nipah and hendra viruses, indicating that these viruses might be present within the geographic distribution of pteropodidae bats in africa.nipah virus in domestic animalsoutbreaks of the nipah virus in pigs and other domestic animals such as horses, goats, sheep, cats and dogs were first reported during the initial malaysian outbreak in 1999.the virus is highly contagious in pigs.

$$Older adolescent (15 to 19 years) and young adult (20 to 24 years) mortality
as a result, the nature of interventions needed to prevent poor health outcomes have shifted away from health sector actions to prevent and treat the infectious diseases of early childhood towards other sectors needed to take action to prevent mortality from road traffic injuries, violence and mental health problems.actions across a range of government sectors including education, transportation and road infrastructure, water and sanitation and law enforcement are needed to prevent premature mortality in older children, adolescents and young adults. the underlying reason for this change is that the cause of death structure shifts from infectious diseases in young children to accidents and injuries primarily among older male adolescents and young adults.however, survival chances for adolescents and young adults also vary greatly across the world.
#
$$Older children and young adolescent mortality (5 to 14 years)
children and young adolescents 5 to 14 years represent approximately 8% of the global cases (9 172 397) and 0.1% of the global deaths (1 444) .data from civil registration and vital statistic systems (crvs), health management information systems (hmis) from 80 countries as well as specific country-wide monitoring systems (mozambique and south africa) indicate no significant deviation from expected mortality for 2020 in this age group and in some cases indicate fewer deaths than would be expected from historical data. what are the leading causes of death?while preterm birth, birth trauma and infectious diseases cause the most deaths in children under 5 years, injuries (including road traffic injuries and drowning) rank among the top causes of death and lifelong disability among older children and young adolescents aged 5–14 years.

in 2019, the top 10 causes of death accounted for 55% of the 55.4 million deaths worldwide.the top global causes of death, in order of total number of lives lost, are associated with three broad topics: cardiovascular (ischaemic heart disease, stroke), respiratory (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory infections) and neonatal conditions – which include birth asphyxia and birth trauma, neonatal sepsis and infections, and preterm birth complications.causes of death can be grouped into three categories: communicable (infectious and parasitic diseases and maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions), noncommunicable (chronic) and injuries. by providing the tools and guidance for rapid mortality surveillance, countries can collect data on total number of deaths by day, week, sex, age and location, thus enabling health leaders to trigger more timely efforts for improvements to health.furthermore, the world health organization develops standards and best practices for data collection, processing and synthesis through the consolidated and improved international classification of diseases (icd-11) – a digital platform that facilitates reporting of timely and accurate data for causes of death for countries to routinely generate and use health information that conforms to international standards.the routine collection and analysis of high-quality data on deaths and causes of death, as well as data on disability, disaggregated by age, sex and geographic location, is essential for improving health and reducing deaths and disability across the world.

$$Trachoma
(1) elimination of trachoma as a public health problem is defined as: (i) a prevalence of trachomatous trichiasis “unknown to the health system” of <0.2% in adults aged ≥15 years (approximately 1 case per 1000 total population), and (ii) a prevalence of trachomatous inflammation – follicular in children aged 1–9 years of <5%, sustained for at least two years in the absence of ongoing antibiotic mass treatment, in each formerly endemic district; plus (iii) the existence of a system able to identify and manage incident trachomatous trichiasis cases, using defined strategies, with evidence of appropriate financial resources to implement those strategies. overall, africa remains the most affected continent and the one with the most intensive control efforts.as of 5 october 2022, 15 countries – cambodia, china, gambia, islamic republic of iran, lao people’s democratic republic, ghana, malawi, mexico, morocco, myanmar, nepal, oman, saudi arabia and vanuatu – had been validated by who as having eliminated trachoma as a public health problem.

$$Trypanosomiasis, human African (sleeping sickness)
without treatment, hat is usually fatal although rare cases of self-cure have been reported.diagnosis diagnosis involves 3 steps:screening for potential infection using serological tests (only available for t. b.gambiense) and clinical examination;confirmation by observing microscopically the parasite in body fluids; andstaging the disease progression via clinical examination and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid obtained by lumbar puncture, if needed.early diagnosis is important to avoid progressing to the neurological stage with more complex and risky treatment.the long, relatively asymptomatic first stage of gambiense-hat is one of the reasons why active screening of exposed populations is done, to detect cases at an early stage and remove them as reservoir. taking the last 5 years:the drc reported 61% of the cases (mean 522 cases/year).angola, central african republic, chad, congo, gabon, guinea, malawi and south sudan declared 10–100 cases, while cameroon, côte d'ivoire, equatorial guinea, uganda, tanzania, ethiopia and zambia declared 1–10 cases.burkina faso, ghana, kenya, nigeria and zimbabwe, reported sporadic cases in the last decade.benin, botswana, burundi, eswatini, gambia, guinea bissau, liberia, mali, mozambique, namibia, niger, rwanda, senegal, sierra leone and togo have not reported cases for over a decade.

$$Tungiasis
in some communities, infection is also linked to ownership of dogs or pigs.thus a long-lasting reduction of incidence and of tungiasis-associated morbidity can only be achieved through a one health approach integrating behaviour change to increase soap use in daily foot washing, spraying floors with insecticide or sealing them, treating animal reservoirs where they are infected and treating humans.the regular application of a repellent based on coconut oil effectively prevents the fleas from penetrating the skin. these result in pain, disability, disfigurement and mutilation of the feet, causing characteristic changes in the way people with tungiasis walk.transmission the main transmission site is inside the sleeping rooms of houses with an unsealed earthen floor where the larvae and pupae develop after the eggs are dropped there.

$$Universal health coverage (UHC)
it covers the full continuum of essential health services, from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care across the life course.the delivery of these services requires health and care workers with an optimal skills mix at all levels of the health system, who are equitably distributed, adequately supported with access to quality assured products, and enjoying decent work.protecting people from the financial consequences of paying for health services out of their own pockets reduces the risk that people will be pushed into poverty because the cost of needed services and treatments requires them to use up their life savings, sell assets, or borrow – destroying their futures and often those of their children.achieving uhc is one of the targets the nations of the world set when they adopted the 2030 sustainable development goals (sdgs) in 2015. in more robust health system settings, who drives public health impact towards health coverage for all through policy dialogue for the systems of the future and strategic support to improve performance.but who is not alone: who works with many different partners in different situations and for different purposes to advance uhc around the world.some of who’s partnerships include:uhc2030uhc partnership global action plan for healthy lives and well-being for all (sdg3 gap)alliance for health policy and systems researchp4h social health protection network
